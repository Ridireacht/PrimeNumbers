# PrimeNumbers
A learning project whose sole purpose is to improve my basics of C#. It is done via solving some simple task with technologies more and more advanced (thus naturally being an 'overkill', nonetheless helping my code skill and also being an original project idea). The die has been cast for calculating prime numbers within given range. Not really intended to be an ideal solution, but I'm trying.

Project contains two folders: one for the console version of the program, and the other for the GUI one. Both are fully functioning, and instead of compiling the code you can just download the latest release with binaries for both included.
