# PrimeNumbers
A project whose sole purpose is to improve my basics of C# knowledge. It is done via solving some simple task with technologies more and more advanced (thus naturally being an 'overkill', nonetheless helping my code skill and also being an original project idea). The die was cast for calculating prime numbers within given range. It isn't intended to be an ideal solution, but my solution. And down below is the list of stages I've planned:

- [X] Write a method to find all prime numbers within the range of 2 given numbers ***(done 11.04.2022)***
  - [X] Implement input of range ends
  - [X] Add checks to those inputs
  - [X] Make calculation method itself (simple trial division)
  - [X] Add output of values calculated
- [X] Prove calculations to be valid, optimize the algorithm itself, fix security issues and simply enchance your program
  - [X] Prepare a function that compares calculated primes with the actual list of primes from an external file, while also counting number of primes checked and saves the last correct one ***(done 12.04.2022)***
  - [X] Optimize algorithm with more accurate range, even/uneven number handler and other stuff ***(done 13.04.2022 - 16.04.2022)***
  - [X] Embed a timer for algorithm and its results' verification function, so you could see their performance ***(done 13.04.2022)***
  - [X] Handle or fix existing exceptions, bugs and other problems, so your program could run stable ***(done 13.04.2022 - 14.04.2022)***
- [X] Optimize function with multi-threading ***(done 17.04.2022)***
  - [X] Implement multi-threading calculations themselves
  - [X] Make sure the right order of primes will be sustained during this
  - [X] Allow program to choose fastest method (of those two) for current range
- [X] Add some database to your program
  - [X] Make it save the calculation results in a database ***(done 18.04.2022 - 19.04.2022)***
  - [X] Use timer to mark the time of DB working ***(done 20.04.2022)***
  - [X] Add an option to either use DB during your calculations, or turn it off ***(done 20.04.2022)***
  - [X] Add an option to clear the DB, so it can be filled once again ***(done 20.04.2022)***
  - [X] If calculations were ever done once, use database's primes instead of recalculating numbers already known ***(done 20.04.2022 - 21.04.2022)***
- [ ] Implement unit-tests for all the things added
  - [X] Tests for isPrime() ***(done 22.04.2022)***
  - [ ] Tests for both SetByInput()
  - [ ] Tests for DB calls
  - [ ] Tests for Verify()
  - [ ] Tests for Calculate()
    - [ ] Mono-threading w/o DB
    - [ ] Multi-threading w/o DB
    - [ ] Mono-threading w/ DB
    - [ ] Multi-threading w/ DB
