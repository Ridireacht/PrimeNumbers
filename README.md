# PrimeNumbers
A project whose sole purpose is to improve my basics of C# knowledge, which is done via solving some really simple task with technologies more and more advanced (thus naturally considered 'overkill', nonetheless helping my code skill). The die was cast for calculating prime numbers (in range of 2 nums). And down below is the list of stages I've planned:

* Write a method to find all prime numbers within the range of 2 given numbers.
* Prove your calculations to be valid with unit tests
* Optimize function with multi-threading
* Make it save the result in a database, and if calculations were ever done once, make it use data from database instead of recalculating numbers already known
* Make the DB calls asynchronous with async/await
* Implement Repository / Unit of Work design pattern on a program
