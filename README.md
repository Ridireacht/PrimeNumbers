# PrimeNumbers
A learning project whose sole purpose is to improve my basics of C#. It is done via solving some simple task with technologies more and more advanced (thus naturally being an 'overkill', nonetheless helping my code skill and also being an original project idea). The die has been cast for calculating prime numbers within given range. Not really intended to be an ideal solution, but I'm trying.

Project contains two folders: one for the console version of the program, and the other for the GUI one. Both are fully functioning, and instead of compiling the code you can just download the latest release with binaries for both included.

## How to use
The application calculates all prime numbers in a given range. The range limits are any natural numbers greater than two. Calculation can be done using three methods: mono-threaded, multi-threaded, and the automatic (selected by default, it chooses between the first and second mode depending on the range). All prime numbers calculated can be displayed in the "output" window on the left (first checkbox option), and/or saved to a separate text file ("Save results to the file" button).
